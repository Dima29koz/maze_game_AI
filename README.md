## Example of use

Train, visualize and evaluate an agent on the `MazeGame-v0` environment:
    
- `sb3_tests/train.py`
- `sb3_tests/visualize.py`

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
maybe you will need to install something more (idk cause of multiple project changes)

```bash
pip install -r req_all.txt
```

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=maze_game/sb3_tests/storage 
```
